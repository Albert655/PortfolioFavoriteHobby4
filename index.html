        <h1>About</h1>
        <p id="secondp">My favorite hobby is playing basketball at my backyard. When I have enough time, I would play basketball. I can shoot hoops at the freethrow range of two points, I can do some trickshots, and I can dribble the ball. I had seen lots of people do trickshots. Also, I can get fresh air when I play basketball. I really like to do the dribbling and I had played basketball on my basketball class since I was in third grade. I actually played some mini-games of basket ball that my basketball teacher know such as "Horse". The goal is that you have to be the last standing person to win. If you miss five times and get the letters that spell HORSE, you lose. Even I liked the warm-ups. The warm-ups made me feel great.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started playing basketball is when I joined the first basketball class that my mom registered me into.I met my friends that I met in the class. I enjoyed the minigames, the rules, and I even knew how to play the real basketball game.</p>

        <h1>My Favorite Minigames</h1>
        <p id="thirdp">My favorite minigames of basket ball is "Horse". I played this the first time since I was in third grade. This game is all about being the last one standing. If you are the last one standing, you win. If you throw the basketball for five attempts (five attempts of not making into the basket) and spell "HORSE", you lose.</p>

        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <p>I started playing the practice of basketball game is when I am chosen to practice the real basketball game. I am in one of my friend's team and my other friend is the team captain.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My team started playing the practice game and we tried very hard. The rules are when someone knocks down a player, it will be a foul, always bounce the ball (also called dribbling the ball), use methods while playing basketball, and do some trickshots.</p>

        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p id="fourthp">I was most inspired by Michael Jordan because he never gave up. Michael Jordan was born in 1963, when almost all of discrimination of African Americans has ended, he had a very tough life against whites, but he never gave up.</p>

        <h2>"One day, you might look up and see me playing the game at 50. Don't laugh. Never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion." -Michael Jordan</h2>
